This program was created as a tool to select a person at random for prize giveaways for the Game & Dev club at Eastern Kentucky University.

The program allows for the entry of string values to be added to a string array. As each entry is entered, the randomizer function is called so that a random numerical
value is stored in a separate integer array. The numerical and string values should have the same position in their respective arrays.

The program will then print the results to the console when the user selects the output function. The program also lists each string value and it's corresponding numerical value.
