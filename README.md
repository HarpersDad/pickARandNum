This program was created as a tool to select a person at random for prize giveaways for the Game & Dev club at Eastern Kentucky University.

The program allows for the entry of string values to be added to an array, then the user can run the randomizer function so that random numerical
values are stored in a separate array.

The program will then print the results to the console when the user selects the output function.  Values stored for each array at array[i] are printed together
so that each string value also has a corresponding numerical value.
